# PowerShell-Winget-Bot

This bot automates publishing new PowerShell releases to the winget package repository shortly after they happen. On GitHub, it should only ever open PRs for new PowerShell versions.

However, software may misbehave or have bugs. If you have a problem with PowerShell-Winget-Bot please [file an issue](https://github.com/PowerShell-Winget-Bot/my-source-code/issues).

[This repo](https://github.com/PowerShell-Winget-Bot/my-source-code) contains the powershell script which I run daily. You may make PRs against it, and my creator @Xaeroxe will review them.
